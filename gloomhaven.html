<p>The story so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>1: while killing some bandits, we discovered that they were teaming up with the undead</li>
<li>2: we recovered a map and a scroll from a crypt following Jekshera's instructions</li>
<li>3: following Jekshera's instructions we murdered a band of Inox who supposedly were bandits. She gave as another mission (to steal a diamond from a mine)</li>
<li>93: looking for a treasure in an island we had to face a group of Lurkers</li>
<li>4: we used the map recovered in (2) to investigate what's the Gloom the bandits were talking about. After discovering a ritual, we got more clues on locations to investigate about these events.</li>
<li>70: we helped to destroy the spirits terrorising and island.</li>
<li>5: we destroyed the cultits' base of operations and came accross an open rift</li>
<li>65: we found schematics for an ancient technology inside a sulfur mine</li>
<li>8: we discovered at Jekshera's warehouse that she was using the scroll we recovered in (2) to raise the dead. We killed her bodyguards, but she escaped and promised to return with an army of undead</li>
<li>10: we entered the rift and were asked by a demon to do a mission for him</li>
<li>21: instead, we killed the demon</li>
<li>14: we obtained an orb for Hail the enchanter. As a reward she provided us with some options to keep finding out Jekshera's location. She will help us from now on. </li>
<li>13: we explored the temple of the seer and obtained information about the location of Jekshera</li>
<li>20: we kill Jekshera. She said that we do not know what is coming</li>
<li>16: after killing Jekshera the captain of the guard asked us to investigate a mountain pass in the north because there was a flying criature. We discovered Inox and demons together. The only clue are some scratchings referencing a 'voice'</li>
<li>18: after killing Jekshera, the captain of the guard gave us the mission to investigate the sewers since the wells are poisoned. We killed some vermlings but they just seemed to live there. No trace of poison. New paths seem to be open to keep investigating. </li>
<li>23: we kept exploring the sewers looking for the reason why the wells are poisoned. This allowed us to reach an ancient cistern withouth learning how to breath underwater first.</li>
<li>26: we solved the mistery of the sewers. By doing so we found some strange writings on the wall. Quatryl, an expert in languages, said that the writings refer to a ritual to corrupt related to an ancient artifact buried in the temple of elements.</li>
<li>57: we went to search for the guard that killed Asia's character's friend just to discover that such guard was in reality an infiltrator.</li>
</ul>
<p>Open options:</p>
<ul>
<li>6: we can investigate what was causing trouble to the cultist which ritual we destroyed</li>
<li>76: side quest</li>
<li>19: we can ask Hail to help us close the rift opened by the cultists in scenario 5</li>
<li>7: we can help Hail to obtain an ingredient to help us find Jekshera (but we already got the location after finishing scenario 13 - the location is scenario 20)</li>
<!--<li>28: we can take a look at what Jekshera referred to when she said: 'you don't know what is coming'</li>-->
<li>24: we can keep going north after the mountain pass to investigate for the flying creature, or</li>
<li>25: we can investigate the cave for more cluse of why inox and demons are together</li>
<li>82: investigate a mountain in flames from which the inox were fleeing (side quest)</li>
<li>43: ask Hail the enchanter for help to let us breath underwater so we can keep exploring the reason why the wells are poisoned (so we can visit scneario 26). We don't need this anymore since we explored an alternative path to 26.</li>
<li>22: first step towards investigating the corrupt ritual and the ancient artifact we learned about after beating scenario 26. This scenario was also a quest we could do for the demon we killed in scnerio 10. </li>
<li>58: keep investigating about the infiltrator we killed in 57 and their plans to harvest bodies.</li>
</ul>
