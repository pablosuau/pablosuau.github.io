<p>The story so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>1: while killing some bandits, we discovered that they were teaming up with the undead</li>
<li>2: we recovered a map and a scroll from a crypt following Jekshera's instructions</li>
<li>3: following Jekshera's instructions we murdered a band of Inox who supposedly were bandits. She gave as another mission (to steal a diamond from a mine)</li>
<li>93: looking for a treasure in an island we had to face a group of Lurkers</li>
<li>4: we used the map recovered in (2) to investigate what's the Gloom the bandits were talking about. After discovering a ritual, we got more clues on locations to investigate about this events.</li>
<li>70: we helped destroying the spirits terrorising and island.</li>
<li>5: we destroyed the cultits' base of operations and came accross an open rift</li>
<li>65: we found schematics for an ancient technology inside a sulfur mine</li>
<li>8: we discovered at Jekshera's warehouse that she was using the scroll we recovered in (2) to raise the dead. We killed her bodyguards, but she escaped and promised to return with an army of undead</li>
<li>10: we entered the rift and were asked by a demon to do a mission for him</li>
<li>21: instead, we killed the demon</li>
</ul>
<p>Open options:</p>
<ul>
<li>6: we can investigate what was causing trouble to the cultist which ritual we destroyed</li>
<li>13, 14: keep searching for Jekshera. In 14 we could also get information about the rift opened by the cultist (that we already closed)</li>
<li>22: nothing prevents us to do what the demon we willed in 10 to do</li>
<li>76: side quest</li>
</ul>
</body>
